The Aati Package Manager focuses on providing a Simple, Efficient and Performant Interface for installing, managing and removing packages that uses a [PKGFILE](https://github.com/hharas/aati/wiki/4.-PKGFILE-Manual)-based packaging system that's easy to use and adopt. Aati can run on both Unix and Windows operating systems.

Read the Wiki (on [GitHub](https://github.com/hharas/aati/wiki) or on [SourceHut](https://man.sr.ht/~haras/aati/)) for more Information how to install Aati, use it, package applications for it, etc.

## But why?

Simply: It was so fun to develop. I always thought of building my own package manager, so here it goes!
