The Aati Package Manager focuses on providing a Simple, Efficient and Performant Interface for installing, managing and removing packages that uses a [PKGFILE](https://man.sr.ht/~haras/aati/pkgfile-manual.md)-based packaging system that's easy to use and adopt. Aati can run on both Unix and Windows operating systems.

Aati's Development is hosted on [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~haras/aati), there is a mirror on [GitHub](https://github.com/hharas/aati) nonetheless. Read the [Wiki](https://man.sr.ht/~haras/aati/) for more Information how to install Aati, use it, package applications for it, etc.

## But why?

Simply: It was so fun to develop. I always thought of building my own package manager, so here it goes!
